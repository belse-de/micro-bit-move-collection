Here's the translated text from German to English(by gpt-4o-mini):

# 1. Start - Hello

## Task:
Display a symbol upon startup.

### Description:
After turning on the robot, a symbol should be displayed. You can choose the symbol freely.

## Required Blocks:
- Basics/at startup
- Basics/display symbol

---

# 2. Time Loop - A Beating Heart

## Task:
Display two symbols upon startup that alternate.

### Description:
After turning on the robot, a symbol (for example: large heart) should be displayed. After a while (for example, after 200ms), another symbol (for example: small heart) should be displayed. After a while (for example, after 200ms), the first symbol should be displayed again.

This should repeat indefinitely.

#### Note
- 200ms is a notation for 200 milliseconds.
- 1000 milliseconds is one second.

## Additionally Required Blocks:
- Basics/indefinitely
- Basics/pause (ms)

# 3. NeoPixel - Let There Be Color
## Task:
Display two different colors on the LED strip at the top. They should alternate on and off, i.e., blink.

### Description:
- The left LED should glow blue.
- The right LED should glow red.
- The middle LED should glow purple/violet.

#### Note
- In the "at startup" block, insert "NeoPixel/set strip to NeoPixel with **5** pixels and mode RGB (GRB format)".
- This step tells the program how to communicate with the LED strip and how many LEDs exist.
- LED = Light Emitting Diode

## Additionally Required Blocks:
- NeoPixel/(strip) display
- NeoPixel/(strip) turn off
- more/(strip) set NeoPixel color (0) to (red)

---

# 4. Input - Buttons -> NeoPixel
## Task:
- When the left button is pressed, the left LED should light up.
- When the right button is pressed, the right LED should light up.
- When both buttons are pressed, the middle LED should light up.
- When no button is pressed, no LED should light up.

### Description:
- The left LED should glow blue.
- The right LED should glow red.
- The middle LED should glow purple/violet.

## Additionally Required Blocks:
- Logic/if (true) then
- Input/button (A) is clicked

---

From here on, the simulator is no longer sufficient. We need to test the programs with the robot.

---

# 5. Input - Light Sensor -> NeoPixel
## Task:
Extend the previous program so that instead of buttons, the robot's light sensors are used. Try to replace "button (A) is clicked", "button (B) is clicked", and "button (A + B) is clicked" with appropriate blocks using l_sensor and r_sensor.

Please ask a supervisor to insert the necessary blocks.

#### Note
- In the "at startup" block, insert "Advanced/Pins/more/pull pin **P15** up".
- In the "at startup" block, insert "Advanced/Pins/more/pull pin **P16** up".
- This step tells the program how to communicate with the light sensors.

## Additionally Required Blocks:
- Advanced/Pins/more/pull pin (P0) up
- Advanced/Pins/digital values from pin (P0)
- Variables/set (variable) to (0)

## Starting Point (JS):
```javascript
let l_sensor = 0
let r_sensor = 0
// Initialization of the right line sensor
pins.setPull(DigitalPin.P15, PinPullMode.PullUp)
// Initialization of the left line sensor
pins.setPull(DigitalPin.P16, PinPullMode.PullUp)
// Initialization of the Neopixel LED strip in
// RGB mode with 5 LEDs
let strip = neopixel.create(DigitalPin.P0, 5, NeoPixelMode.RGB)
basic.forever(function () {
    // Store the current value of the line sensor in
    // the variable: "r_sensor"
    //
    // Read the current value of the right line sensor
    r_sensor = pins.digitalReadPin(DigitalPin.P15)
    // Store the current value of the line sensor in
    // the variable: "l_sensor"
    //
    // Read the current value of the left line sensor
    l_sensor = pins.digitalReadPin(DigitalPin.P16)
    // If the right line sensor sees white, turn the
    // right LED to red
    if (l_sensor == 0 && r_sensor == 1) {
        strip.setPixelColor(0, neopixel.colors(NeoPixelColors.Red))
    }
    // The previous program
    //
    // [...]
    //
})
```

# 6. Output - Light Sensor -> Motor
## Task:
Extend the previous program so that the robot can follow the black line. For this, you need to insert the blocks for Forward (drive forward), Left (turn left), Right (turn right), and Stop (stop) from Servo:Lite into the correct places in your program.

### Description:
Consider:
- What do the sensors "see" when the robot is centered on the line?
- What do the sensors "see" when the robot is turned on the line?
- In which direction should the robot move when it is centered, turned, or perpendicular to the line?

## Additionally Required Blocks:
- Servo:Lite/drive forward
- Servo:Lite/turn left
- Servo:Lite/turn right
- Servo:Lite/stop

---

Congratulations!

If you have successfully completed all the tasks up to this point, your robot should now be able to follow a black line without any problems.
